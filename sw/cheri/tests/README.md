# Sonata Software Tests

These tests test the sonata system's hardware.
They are simple, only intended to catch regressions.
CHERIoT RTOS functionality is not tested here but in the CHERIoT RTOS test suite found in [`cheriot-rtos/tests`](https://github.com/CHERIoT-Platform/cheriot-rtos/tree/main/tests).
