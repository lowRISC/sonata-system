# Overview

This stub just immediately jumps to the entry point for binaries loaded with the
SPI flash bootloader. It's intended to be used with a Sonata simulation to allow
use of unmodified binaries that have been built for use with the flash
bootloader.

To build the stub a CHERIoT toolchain must be available on the path. The
makefile handles the build just run `make`.
