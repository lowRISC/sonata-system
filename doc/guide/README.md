# Getting started with the Sonata board

This guide helps you to get started with the Sonata board by building code with CHERIoT technology enabled.
One more advanced feature of Sonata is you can adjust the number and type of peripherals included.
This is described in the section [FPGA Development](../dev/fpga-development.md), for this getting started guide you will use one of the default setups.

> The Sonata board is a prototype board and is under active development.
> This documentation is in the process of being updated.
> Some parts of the documentation may be out of date or otherwise confusing because of this.
> This getting started material and the documentation in the [sonata-software](https://lowrisc.github.io/sonata-software/doc/getting-started.html) repository provides the best material for new users to focus on.

See the following section for steps getting started steps on how to update the Sonata system.
