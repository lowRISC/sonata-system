Ibex has originally been developed by the PULP team at ETH Zürich and
University of Bologna under the name Zero-riscy. In December 2018, Ibex has
been contributed to lowRISC who is maintaining and advancing the design since
then.

Throughout the years, Ibex has seen contributions from many people and we at
lowRISC are very thankful for all of them. This file lists the many people who
contributed to what is called Ibex today. If you made a contribution to Ibex
in the form of source code, bug reports, testing, marketing, or any other form,
please feel free to open a pull request to get your name added to this file.

The Cheriot-ibex ibex is developed as part of the Microsoft open-source effort, 
based on the lowRISC ibex design. The names of people contributed to cheriot-ibex
